## CUDA and OpenMP Programs
# Below are the instructions on how to run these programs. 

---

## Prerequisites

1. **CUDA Toolkit**: Ensure you have the CUDA Toolkit installed on your system. You can download it from [NVIDIA's official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
2. **OpenMP Support**: Ensure your compiler supports OpenMP (e.g., `gcc` for Linux).
3. **Compiler**:
   - Use `nvcc` for CUDA programs.
   - Use `gcc` for OpenMP programs.

## How to Run the Programs

### CUDA Programs

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.cu` files.
3. Compile the desired program using `nvcc` (e.g., `nvcc -o output_file source_file.cu`).
4. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./output_file`).

Example:
```bash
nvcc -o <file_name.cu> <file_name.out>

./<file_name.out>
```

### OpenMP Programs

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.c` files.
3. Compile the desired program using `gcc` with the `-fopenmp` flag (e.g., `gcc -o output_file source_file.c -fopenmp`).
4. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./output_file`).

Example:
```bash
gcc -fopenmp <file_name.c> -o <file_name.out>

./<file_name.out>
```
