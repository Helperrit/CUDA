- **CO Mapping**: 1, 2

### 2. Parallel Programming Environment Information
- **Task**: Write an OpenMP program to print parallel programming environment information.
- **CO Mapping**: 1, 2

### 3. Array Addition in Parallel
- **Task**: Write an OpenMP program to add two arrays in parallel using the dynamic clause and defining chunk size.
- **CO Mapping**: 1, 2

### 4. Array Addition and Subtraction with Sections
- **Task**: Write an OpenMP program to add and subtract two arrays with two different threads (work sharing using section clause).
- **CO Mapping**: 1, 2

### 5. Sum of Array Elements Using Reduction Clause
- **Task**: Write an OpenMP program to find the sum of array elements by demonstrating the usage of the reduction clause (`sum = sum + a[i]`).
